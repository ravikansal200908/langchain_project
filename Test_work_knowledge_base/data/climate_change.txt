Title: Climate Change and Its Impact

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. These activities increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.

Consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss.

Mitigation strategies include switching to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and protecting forests.
