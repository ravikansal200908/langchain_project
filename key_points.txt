LLM : 
- What is LLM?
- What is Base LLM and Instruction Tuned LLM?
- What is prompt injection?
- What are the techniques to avoid the prompt injections?
- What are the best practices to write the prompts?
    - Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
        - Use delimiters
        - Ask for structured output like HTML, JSON
        - Check weather conditions are satisfied
            - Check the assumptions required to do the task.
        - Few-short prompting.
            - Give successful example of the completing tasks
            - Then ask model to perform the task
    - Principle 2: Give the model time to think
        - Specify the steps to complete a task
        - Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
- Model Limitations: 
    - Hallucinations
        - Make statements that sound plausible but are not true.
    - Reducing hallucinations
        - First find relevant information, then answer the question based on the relevant information.

- Iterative Prompt Development
    - Be clear and specific
    - Analyze why the result does not give desire output
    - Refine the idea and the prompt
    - Repeat

    - Iterative Process
        - Try something
        - Analyze where the result does not give what you want
        - Clarify instruction, give more time to think
        - Refine prompts with a batch of examples
